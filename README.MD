A simple ROS application that passess information between two ROS system using roslib.js.

## How to use:
1. Clone this repo on both ROS systems.

## Python Interface
It is highly recommende to use the python interface to communicate:

```
from multi_robot_relay import MultiBotInterface

interface = MultiBotInterface()
signal = interface.wait_for_robot(OTHER_ROBOT_ID) #wait for any signal from other robot
interface.send_signal('DONE') #send a text signal to all subscribing robots

```
